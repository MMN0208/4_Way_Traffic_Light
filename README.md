Our project contains the following features:
- O(1) scheduler.
- Automatic and manual modes for 4-way traffic lights.
- Changing green and yellow lights time of traffic lights.
- A button interrupt for pedestrian light with a PWM buzzer.
- UART communication for transmitting the seven-segment display of traffic light countdown and time setting.

Contributions:
- Mai Minh Nhat: I/O configurations, Cooperative Scheduler and FSMs implementation.
- Tran Quang Kiet: Buzzer interfacing using PWM generation from TIM3.
- Tran Trung Nguyen: Code refactoring and testing.
- Nguyen Tran Anh Quan: FSMs design and preparing slides.
